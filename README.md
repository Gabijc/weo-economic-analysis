# Analysis of GDP, CPI, and unemployment rates

## 📖 Description

This project provides a detailed temporal analysis and forecast of key economic indicators, including GDP, CPI, and unemployment rates. The data is sourced from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO).

The goal of this project is to create alternative analyses and projections to those officially provided by the WEO, which are often needed by country governments and policymakers to inform long-term strategies. The analysis covers the past 30 years and provides forecasts for different economic country groups and individual countries. This will allow local governments, policymakers, and IMF analysts to compare the insights obtained with the official WEO data.
